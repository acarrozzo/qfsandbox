# (secure) route group hooks

Hooks in this directory are intended to only be used by components rendered under the (secure) route group.

However, some components in the src/components directory still need this hook, so they may import it as long as they are rendered under the (secure) route group.

## Examples

```typescript
  // src/app/(secure)/(with-nav)/dashboard/page.tsx

  const { me } = useMe() // Ok
```

```typescript
  // src/app/login/page.tsx

  const { me } = useMe() // Error
```
