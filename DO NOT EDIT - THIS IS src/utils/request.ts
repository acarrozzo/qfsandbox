 * Our local.magicsky.dev reverse proxy forwards requests to http://localhost:3005,
 * which works fine when going through the browser. For internal fetches, however,
 * we have two paths:
 *
 * 1. Use https://local.magicsky.dev as the origin. This is straightforward, but
 *    requires managing TLS certificates that we donâ€™t want to distribute locally.
 *
 * 2. Use http://localhost:3005 directly. The challenge is that in this case
 *    Next.js reports req.nextUrl.origin as https://localhost, which is inaccurate
 *    for our setup. To avoid this mismatch, we reconstruct the expected
 *    http://localhost:3005 origin explicitly when the hostname is localhost.
